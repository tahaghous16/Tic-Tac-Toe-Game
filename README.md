# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! This project is a simple yet classic implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

## Overview

This project showcases a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game where players take turns to mark a 3x3 grid with 'X' or 'O'. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all the boxes are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The game is built using Bootstrap, making it responsive and suitable for various screen sizes.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players take turns, and the game automatically checks for a winner or a draw.
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can reset the game at any time to start a new game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the game.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive and modern UI components.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for game functionality, including player turns and winner detection.
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for game elements.

## Game Logic

- **Player Turns**: Players take turns clicking on the grid boxes. Player 'O' starts the game.
- **Winner Detection**: The game checks for winning patterns after each turn. If a player aligns three of their marks, they win, and a message is displayed.
- **Reset Game**: Players can reset the game using the "New Game" or "Reset Game!" buttons.
